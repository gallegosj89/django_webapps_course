### Todo App in Django

The project involves the building of a todo application. In a todo app, a user can keep track of all the things he/she is planning to do and create a list. They can then update the list when the task is completed. Build a nice app with basic Html, CSS, and JavaScript and host on the localhost server using Django or Flask framework.

### Dictionary Web App

### Railway Enquiry System

The Indian railway system has provided us with an API from railapi.com through which we can gather all the information about the status of the train, PNR number, etc in real-time. The idea of this project is to create a web app using the railapi that will give us all the information about the user queries related to the railway.

## Advanced Django Project Ideas

### Clothes Online Store with Payment

Another good project is to build a web application for an online store. Users can buy merchandise from the store so we also need to set up a payment module to handle transactions.

### Interactive Web Maps

An interactive web map uses data and animations to provide an amazing experience to the users. It is challenging to build an interactive map as the graphics had to be changed according to the user interacting with the map.

### Django Social Network App

The social network app is a platform for people to communicate with each other, make friends, and express their views through text, images, etc. We should also think about the security and privacy of the userâ€™s data as they will use this app to have private conversations.

### Django Pinterest clone

Build an amazing web app for users to showcase their artistic skills of photography, paintings, portraits, etc. The users can like posts and follow different artists to explore their latest posts from their feed.

### News Aggregator Web Application
